Hi, I am Abinav Ravi venkatakrishnan, Call me Abinav. 

I am passionate about machine learning, Currently working on my master thesis in the field of Uncertainty in Deep learning.
I am into Computer vision, Medical imaging. I am also interested in generative models and trying to get a more detail understanding at the moment. 

I am a master's student of Computational Science and Engineering at The Technical University of Munich. 

* Completed Master thesis on [Self Supervised Out of Distribution detection for Medical application](../resources/thesis.pdf) under the supervision of [Dr.Kim SeongTae](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/SeongTae) at [CAMPAR](http://campar.in.tum.de/Chair/ResearchGroupCamp).  
* I have been selected as part of OpenMined research as a research engineer to work on project of Outlier robust aggregators for Federated learning. 
* I worked with [Suprosanna](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/SuprosannaShit) in [Image Based Biomedical Modelling](http://campar.in.tum.de/Chair/ResearchIBBM) lab on 'Solving Inverse Problem in PDE using deep learning'.
* I am currently a Data Scientist at [Deepc](http://deepc.ai/)
* I was previously a Junior Data Scientist- Working student at [Deepc](http://deepc.ai/)
* I used to work as Working student-Data Science at [The Mobility House](https://www.mobilityhouse.com/int_en/)
