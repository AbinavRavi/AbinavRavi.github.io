Hi, I am Abinav Ravi venkatakrishnan, Call me Abinav. 

* I am passionate about machine learning since it is all about optimization something every human strives for in their life.

* I am interested in  Computer vision and  Medical imaging. I am also interested in generative models and trying to get a more detail understanding at the moment. 

**Learn With me:**
This is my new attempt to log in details of my learnings from various code and courses that I do across many of my favorite subjects. You can find the notes on [Blog](https://abinavravi.github.io/). 

* My current learning aim is learning about federated learning and Differential privacy
* For federated learning. I am following papers and using Pysyft to implement some stuff (Demo Coming soon)
* I am following the course by Prof.Gautam Kamath on [Algorithms for Private data analysis](http://www.gautamkamath.com/CS860-fa2020.html)

I am a master's student of Computational Science and Engineering at The Technical University of Munich. 

* Completed Master thesis on [Self Supervised Out of Distribution detection for Medical application](../resources/thesis.pdf) under the supervision of [Dr.Kim SeongTae](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/SeongTae) at [CAMPAR](http://campar.in.tum.de/Chair/ResearchGroupCamp).  
* I have been selected as part of OpenMined research as a research engineer to work on project of Outlier robust aggregators for Federated learning. 
* I worked with [Suprosanna](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/SuprosannaShit) in [Image Based Biomedical Modelling](http://campar.in.tum.de/Chair/ResearchIBBM) lab on 'Solving Inverse Problem in PDE using deep learning'.
* I am currently a Data Scientist at [Deepc](http://deepc.ai/)
* I was previously a Junior Data Scientist- Working student at [Deepc](http://deepc.ai/)
* I used to work as Working student-Data Science at [The Mobility House](https://www.mobilityhouse.com/int_en/)
