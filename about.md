Hi, I am Abinav. 

## What do I do for work
My job is to run convert mathematical models in code to production grade software. What are these mathematical models in code? These are what people nowadays call **AI**. I have experience of building and making them available to users for about 4 years now across organizations. 

## What skills do I have
- Programming Languages - Python(Advanced), Rust(Intermediate), Go(Intermediate), C(Intermediate), bash(Intermediate), Javascript(basic),Julia, Mojo
- Data Science tools -Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn, scikit image, Pytorch, Pandas, OpenCV, Flask, PySyft, Plotly Dash,PySpark, Tensorflow
- Database PostrgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, DuckDB, SQLite
- DevOps/MLOps Tool Docker, Kubernetes, Gitlab runner, Jenkins, Terraform, MLFlow, feast (fea-
ture store), Kubeflow, Flyte.
- Cloud Platforms - AWS (S3 and EC2, ECR, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM), GCP (Cloud Composer, GCS, SecretManager, VertexAI)
- LLM tools OpenAI API, Huggingface APIs, Instructor, Ollama, deepeval, Gemini API
