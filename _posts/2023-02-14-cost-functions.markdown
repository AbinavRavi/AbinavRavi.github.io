## AIM OF MACHINE LEARNING

Machine Learning or Deep Learning can be viewed as function approximation based on data. What this means in simpler terms is that given a set of data points the aim is to get a function that can represent each of the data point very well and this function generalizes across many such similar data points.

### LOSS FUNCTION
Loss function is the function that can depict the error between the predicted function value at a data point and the actual value. Loss functions are measured over single datum points. 

### COST FUNCTION
Cost function also denotes the error between predicted value and actual value but for a batch of data values. 

### OBJECTIVE FUNCTION

### MOST COMMON LOSS FUNCTIONS
