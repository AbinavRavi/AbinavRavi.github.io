Recently I had a talk with a senior engineer from my organisation and he was an advocate for better looking terminal with oh-my-zsh and themes. His argument was Bash terminals are boring and since he was a nvim user he wnated to give the terminal a makeover. So I came under the spell of good looking terminals and decided to experiment by changing terminals in my personal notebook which runs an Ubuntu 20.04. Here are the steps that I did and the way you can replicate them for your terminal too. 

Most of the blog is a mixture of my steps in transforming my terminal from bash to zsh and learning taken from other blogs, I have tried to cite them as much as possible. If something is left out I apologise for it now.
