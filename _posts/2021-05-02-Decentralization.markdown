The pandemic has changed a lot of our working styles. I was recently watching an interview of Sridhar Vembu the CEO of Zoho corporation talking about his move to the rural areas and building companies and workforce there and I am just mirroring his thoughts through this post. It is fascinating to imagine a world post pandemic in this way. 

Imagine if the pandemic is meant as a force of God (or something you believe) to make the world a more decentralized place. With the growth of social networking and Internet, communication with people have become more easier than before. I still remember in early 2000's where only one person in the house could afford a mobile phone and there was a landline apart from mobile phone which was used by the entire family. Messages were generally conveyed through voice or through letters if there is an urge to write. Today I sit miles away from home and still speak with my parents face to face with reasonable clarity. 

With bitcoin and dogecoin making big noise in the world its time we think about decentralization as a concept for life as well. As a thought experiment I would like to imagine how work places can be structured in decentralized fashion. 

1. Instead of centralized workforce sitting in one office (for work which can be done online and from home) we can have co-working space which can be sponsored by the office. A good way to think about this is to have a co-working space for a block and it can be a community experience for these people to work together.
