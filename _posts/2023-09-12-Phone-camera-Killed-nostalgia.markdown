I have been on social media actively lurking around and liking posts, my posts are the occasional photo dump. I have never posted a instagram story nor do I intend to do anyday soon. Recently I saw that many of my real life friends go to a concert and then take a video of the concert while the performance is on. This somehow makes me want to grab phones of the audience and throw it away.

Now I am not an unreasonable man who is saying you shouldnt take a 30s clip of a song to show your friends that you are in a concert. But off late I see a rush of stories or status that are filled with 30s of each song performed. Now I may sound old and like a boomer but what happened to just enjoying the performance and beauty of it. From my limited interactions with people who do this their justification is that We are saving this for memories. 

My retorting question is if you save it for the future by capturing it on a phone now, are you not living in the present? which brings me to the major opposition point to such behavior. The mankind has always lived on stories and nostalgia of some events from the past. When we meet for parties, dinner etc the conversation generally revolves around such memories and I feel not capturing all of them on a phone allows for some creative liberty in life. You can always add superlative adjectives and make your friends, family and acquaintances jealous of the fact. But if you do show some proof they can come to a judgement call about your memory and can easily spoil it for you.
