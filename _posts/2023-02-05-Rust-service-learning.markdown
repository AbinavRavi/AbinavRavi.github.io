I have been hearing rave reviews about Rust Lang and how it can improve performance, about memory safe code etc. So I decided to give it a try myself. I have previously tried multiple time to learn rust using the [rust language book](). However the attempt has been a failure as I havent done any projects and learning a new language requires a bit of practice. 

So I thought why not code a simple service which will act as the backend for login service with two factor authentication via email. The idea would be that I would be programming something relatively easy (considering that it will not be used in production so that the newest security is not considered). There would be some routes and I can practice the basic concepts of Data Structures used in rust, borrowing, shadowing, ownership etc.

### Struct and Impl

Struct is a datatype which can be customized as per our needs, In rust we can implement methods associated with each of the struct and then use it for providing basic properties of the struct. It is very similar to writing a class in other OOP languages, where a method can be associated with an object. 

### Crates and Modules

Coming from a python background this was one of the early things which confused me. How to create modular code and use the functions.
